This project features an implementation of classic divide-and-conquer algorithms in Java 17, incorporating safe recursion techniques, comprehensive metrics gathering, and empirical validation against theoretical asymptotic behavior.


Learning goals

• Implement classic divide-and-conquer algorithms with safe recursion patterns

• Analyze running-time recurrences using Master Theorem (3 cases) and Akra–Bazzi intuition; validate
with measurements.

• Collect metrics (time, recursion depth, comparisons/allocations) and communicate results via a short
report and clean Git history.



Algorithms:

MergeSort

QuickSort

Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)

Closest Pair of Points (2D)
