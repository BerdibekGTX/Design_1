# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab

This project features an implementation of classic divide-and-conquer algorithms in Java 17, incorporating safe recursion techniques, comprehensive metrics gathering, and empirical validation against theoretical asymptotic behavior.

## Learning goals

• Implement classic divide-and-conquer algorithms with safe recursion patterns

• Analyze running-time recurrences using Master Theorem (3 cases) and Akra–Bazzi intuition; validate
with measurements.

• Collect metrics (time, recursion depth, comparisons/allocations) and communicate results via a short
report and clean Git history.


## Algorithms:

MergeSort

QuickSort

Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)

Closest Pair of Points (2D)


## The execution tracks the following performance metrics:

Execution Time: The duration the algorithm takes to run on various input sizes.

Recursion Depth: The maximum level of recursive calls reached during execution.

Number of Comparisons: The total comparisons performed by the algorithm.

Memory Allocations: The count of memory allocation operations made.

These metrics are recorded in CSV files for subsequent analysis.


































## Conclusion
The project efficiently implements four fundamental divide-and-conquer algorithms, evaluates their runtime complexities, and collects detailed performance data. The findings validate the theoretical complexity analyses and offer valuable insights into how each algorithm performs under different conditions.
